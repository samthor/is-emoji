[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samthor/ok-emoji.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samthor/ok-emoji)

Provides JavaScript helpers for working with emoji.

This includes code to swap or modify gender, and adjust the skin tone of emoji.
There's also some browser-only code to guess whether an emoji is supported on your user's platform.
It's browser-only as it requires `HTMLCanvasElement` or `OffscreenCanvas`.

Updated for [Unicode 13.0](https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/13.0/).
Generation code for "defs.js" is in Go at [tr51/datagen](https://github.com/samthor/tr51/tree/master/datagen).
